<p> Welcome to <b>GARAGE!</b>  We are a monthly subscription service that gives our members access to the best classes and experiences in their city.</p>

<p>The Garage website (the “<b>Site</b>”) is operated by Garage Ltd. (“<b>Garage</b>”).</p>

<p>Please read carefully the following Terms of Use, which may be updated by Garage from time to time without notice to you (the Terms of Use, as modified from time to time, the “<b>Terms</b>”).  The most current version of the Terms can be accessed at any time at <a href="/terms">https://localhost:3000/terms</a>
</p>
<p>
<ol type=”1”>

<p><li>     <b>Acceptance of Terms of Use </b></li>
By accessing, browsing, and/or using the Site, you accept and agree to be bound to these Terms.  In addition, when using particular Garage services, you also shall be subject to any posted guidelines, <a href="https://localhost:3000/faq" target="_blank">FAQs</a>, or rules applicable to such services, which may be posted and modified from time to time.</p>
<p><li>    <b> Membership </b> </li>
Members receive classes (“<b>Eligible Classes</b>”) to be used to attend any experience available on our platform up to as many times as assigned by each supplier for each member. Members cannot transfer or gift classes to third parties, including other Garage members.  Garage reserves the right to increase from time to time in its sole discretion the number of Eligible Classes a member can take for a given Experience. Garage makes no guarantee on the availability of classes as access to classes is on a space-available basis.</p>
<p><li>     <b>Membership Cycle</b> </li>
Your Garage membership starts on the date that you sign up for a subscription and submit payment via a valid Payment Method. Each Garage cycle is one month in length, and will automatically renew each month.  For example, if you purchase your Garage on April 5, your membership will automatically renew on May 5 (see “Billing Cycles,” below).  You must provide us with a current, valid, accepted method of payment (as such may be updated from time to time, “<b>Payment Method</b>”) to use Garage.  We automatically will bill the monthly membership fee to your Payment Method each month until your Garage is cancelled or terminated.</p>
<li>   <b>  Billing </b></li>
<ol type=”a”>
<p><li> <b><i> Recurring Billing</i></b>. By starting your Garage membership, you authorise us to charge you a monthly membership fee at the then current rate.</li></p>
<p><li> <b><i>Billing Cycle</i></b>. When you sign up and purchase your Garage, your first subscription cycle will be billed immediately. Your subscription will auto-renew and you will be billed on the same date each month. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, as indicated below, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled. In the event your paying membership began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your Garage membership or became a paying member on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your Payment Method would be billed on that date. Your renewal date may change due to changes in your Membership.</li></p>
<p><li><b><i>No Refunds</i></b>. PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED PERIODS. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members (“credits”). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.</li></p>
<p><li><b><i>Payment Methods</i></b>. You may edit your Payment Method information by emailing us at <a href="#" target="_top">hello@Garage.com</a>. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account (see, “Cancellation” below), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorise us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates.</li></p>
<p><li> <b><i>Cancellation</i></b>. You may terminate your monthly subscription at any time with 3 days notice by going under your account settings on the site. However, your first month cannot be cancelled and is non-refundable. </li></p></ol>

<p><li>    <b> Other Fees</b></li>
Your Garage covers your access to classes. In addition, you are responsible for paying cancellation fees if you do not cancel your class with appropriate notice. Some of our venues may also charge equipment or other amenity fees. The Garage only gives you access to the class for which you signed up. The venue may have additional fees for use of additional classes or spaces.</p>
<p><li> <b>    Termination by Garage.</b> </li>
You agree that Garage, in its sole discretion and for any or no reason, may terminate any account (or any part thereof) you may have with Garage or use of the Site and remove and discard all or any part of your account or any content uploaded by you, at any time. Garage may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing access to the Site, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Site or any account you may have or portion thereof may be effected without prior notice, and you agree that Garage will not be liable to you or any third party for any such termination. Garage does not permit copyright infringing activities on the Site and reserves the right to terminate access to the Site and remove all content submitted by any persons who are found to be repeat infringers. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of the Site may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities.
